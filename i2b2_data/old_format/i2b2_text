However the same problem recurred for a third time and a computer tomogram scan at an outside hospital showed an anterior hematoma . 
However on 09/08/98 the Infectious Disease Service was made aware that the patient 's intraoperative cultures had also grown out Mycoplasma humilius . 
Given this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of Vancomycin and then subsequent Levofloxacin for the Citrobacter and Mycoplasma as well .

His neck was rigid ; 1+ carotids without bruits . 
However , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .

The etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out . 
In addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely . 
This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy . 
Motor examination he had a weak withdrawal to nail bed pressure in both hands . 
He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation . 
His anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .

Review of systems was significant for menopausal symptoms ( for which she has attempted hormone replacement therapy , discontinued in 2014 ). 
The etiology of these cardiovascular episodes was unclear , but was felt likely secondary to the patient 's tenuous cardiovascular status given the fact that she had clear pulmonary hypertension , was very preload dependent , and had an intact left ventricular function but with cardiac output limited due to left ventricular compression by a dilated left ventricle .
